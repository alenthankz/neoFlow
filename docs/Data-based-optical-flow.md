## Deep Learning based Flow

Some of the famous DL based methods are : 

1) Flownet and Flownet2

2) PWC Net

3) SPYNet

4) TV-L1 based neural net


There are many other knowledge distillation based methods like DDFlow which uses one of the above architectures in the backend, and use Teacher-Student based networks to improve accurany for occluded pixels
